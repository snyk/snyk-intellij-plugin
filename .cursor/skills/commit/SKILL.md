# Commit Workflow

Prepare, verify, and commit code changes following project standards.

## Workflow Overview

```
Verify → Fix Issues (TDD) → Pre-commit Checks → Commit → Tests → [Push]
```

## Quick Start Checklist

Copy and track progress:

```
Commit Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Run verification skill
- [ ] Step 2: Fix issues using TDD
- [ ] Step 3: Run pre-commit checks
- [ ] Step 4: Create atomic commit
- [ ] Step 5: Run ALL test suites (3 REQUIRED):
      - [ ] ./gradlew ktlintCheck spotlessApply
      - [ ] ./gradlew koverXMLReport
      - [ ] ./gradlew verifyPlugin
- [ ] Step 6: Push (optional, ask first)
```

**CRITICAL: Step 5 has THREE mandatory test suites. Skipping any is FORBIDDEN.**

---

## Step 1: Run Verification Skill

Execute the **verification** skill to analyze code changes:

```
Verification Progress:
- [ ] Load project rules and standards
- [ ] Trace code paths for modified files
- [ ] Check for semantic changes
- [ ] Identify code smells
- [ ] Run security scans
- [ ] Review PR feedback (if PR exists)
```

Read and follow: `.cursor/skills/verification/SKILL.md`

**Output**: List of issues found, categorized by severity.

---

## Step 2: Fix Issues Using TDD

For each issue identified by verification:

### TDD Gate (MANDATORY)

Before ANY fix:

- [ ] Write failing test first
- [ ] Confirm test fails without fix
- [ ] Implement minimal fix
- [ ] Confirm test passes

**Never skip TDD. Use `implementation` skill for complex fixes.**

### Issue Priority

1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Fix immediately (except test data)
2. **Breaking changes** - Confirm intentional, add tests
3. **Code smells** - Fix immediately
4. **PR feedback** - Address blockers first

---

## Step 3: Pre-commit Checks

Run:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck spotlessApply
./gradlew koverXMLReport
./gradlew verifyPlugin
```

### Security Scans

Get absolute path first:

```bash
pwd
```

Then run:

1. `snyk_sca_scan` with absolute project path
2. `snyk_code_scan` with absolute project path

**Fix any security issues** (skip test data false positives).

---

## Step 4: Create Atomic Commit

### Pre-commit Verification

```
- [ ] Linting clean (./gradlew ktlintCheck spotlessApply)
- [ ] Security scans clean
- [ ] No implementation plan files staged
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
```

### Commit Format

```
type(scope): description [XXX-XXXX]

Body explaining what and why.
```

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf

**Extract issue ID from branch:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

### Staged Files Check

```bash
# Review what will be committed
git status
git diff --staged
```

**Never commit**:

- Implementation plan files (`*_implementation_plan/`)
- Secrets or credentials
- Generated diagram source (commit PNGs only if needed)

### Execute Commit

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): description [XXX-XXXX]

Body explaining what and why.
EOF
)"
```

**NEVER use --no-verify. NEVER amend commits.**

---

## Step 5: Run All Test Suites (After Commit, Before Push)

**CRITICAL: ALL three test suites MUST be executed after commit but before push. Skipping ANY test suite is FORBIDDEN.**

### Execution Order

Run these commands IN ORDER and wait for each to complete:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck spotlessApply
./gradlew koverXMLReport
./gradlew verifyPlugin
```

### Test Gate Enforcement

**Before proceeding to Step 6, verify:**

1. Did `./gradlew ktlintCheck spotlessApply` complete with all tests passing?
2. Did `./gradlew koverXMLReport` complete with all tests passing?
3. Did `./gradlew verifyPlugin` complete with all tests passing?

If ANY answer is "no" or "I didn't run it", STOP and run the missing tests.

### Test Failure Protocol

If tests fail:

1. **Do not proceed** to push
2. Identify root cause
3. Apply TDD fix (test first, then implementation)
4. Create new commit with fix
5. Re-run ALL test suites (not just the one that failed)
6. Continue only when ALL three test suites pass

---

## Step 6: Push (Optional)

### Mandatory Test Checklist

You MUST run each test suite and check it off. Do NOT proceed to push until ALL boxes are checked:

```
Test Suite Checklist (ALL REQUIRED):
      - [ ] ./gradlew ktlintCheck spotlessApply
      - [ ] ./gradlew koverXMLReport
      - [ ] ./gradlew verifyPlugin
```

**Always ask before pushing.**

If approved:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### After Push

Offer to:

1. Create draft PR (if none exists)
2. Update PR description (if PR exists)
3. Check snyk-pr-review-bot comments
4. Run `sleep` for 60s
5. Read and run verification skill
