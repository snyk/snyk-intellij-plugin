refactor: optimise JS initialisation and event handling in JBCefBrowser

- Use event delegation for the `.data-flow-clickable-row` elements. This change reduces the
  number of event listeners attached to the DOM by binding a single listener on
  the document rather than individual listeners on each element.
- Prevent redefinition of the `openFileQuery` function initialising just once per page load.
